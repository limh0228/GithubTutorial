# Supplementary Lab Template
The supplementary labs are short, simple labs that introduce additional Git commands to users. To create a supplementary lab, copy and paste the template below into a new file under the [`supplementary_labs`](.) folder. Pick a new Git command to research, and write up your own lab, filling in the template. Use [`CheckingYourStatus`](CheckingYourStatus.md) as an example lab.

You can choose any Git command you want, but here are a few simple ones to choose from if you are having trouble picking:
- git log
- git checkout
- git status
- git log --graph
- git diff
- git reset
- git rebase
- git fetch
- git merge
